I am an associate professor & Distinguished Research and Teaching Fellow of Management Analytics at Smith School of Business, Queen’s University. I received my Ph.D. from the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California (2016), M.Eng. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, M.Sc. from National University of Singapore, and B.Eng. from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

My research primarily spans the following two areas:

(1) Revenue management and retail operations. I am particularly interested in modeling customer behaviors and seeking solutions to high-impact revenue management and retail operations problems, such as assortment planning, price optimization, and retail decisions.

(2) Policy design and policy-driven decision-making. This stream of research topics is usually interdisciplinary, lying at the intersection of operations management and other business domains, such as marketing, accounting, and strategy. Here, I am interested in investigating the impact of government policy and regulation and firms’ pricing and promotion strategies on business decisions, along with their impact on consumer and social welfare.





A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
